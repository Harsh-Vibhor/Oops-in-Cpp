📌 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm(i.e. way of writing code) that organizes code by modeling real-world entities using classes and objects. It provides a structured and modular way to write programs, making them easier to understand, maintain, and scale.

In real-world software development and organizations, OOP is widely used because it reflects how real-world systems work and helps manage complex applications efficiently.

📘 Class and Object Concept

A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (data) and behaviors (functions) of an object.

An object is a real instance of a class created using that blueprint.

🔹 Real-World Example

Consider a University Faculty Management System.

To store faculty information, we need details like:

Name

Department

Subject

Instead of writing separate code for each faculty member, we define a Faculty class that acts as a blueprint.

class Faculty {
    string name;
    string department;
    string subject;
};


Using this class, we can create multiple faculty objects, each representing an individual faculty member with different values.

Here:

Class → Faculty (blueprint)

Objects → Individual faculty members

Benefit → Code reuse, consistency, and easier maintenance

✅ Benefits of OOP

Code reusability

Better organization and readability

Easier maintenance and scalability

Real-world problem modeling

Reduced code duplication

🔚 Summary

OOP allows us to write clean, reusable, and organized code by using classes as blueprints and objects as real-world entities created from those blueprints.
