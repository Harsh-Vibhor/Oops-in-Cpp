There are four pillars of OOP 🏛️
One of them is Encapsulation.

🔹 Encapsulation means wrapping data members (variables) and methods (functions) together into a single unit called a class 📦.

It is mainly used to achieve data hiding 🔒.

👉 In simple words:
Encapsulation decides what data should be visible and what data should be hidden from the outside world.

Understanding with a real-life example 🏦

Think of a banking system.

An account has:

Account ID

Username

Password

Balance

Now, as a user:

✅ You can see account ID and username

❌ You should NOT directly access password and balance

So what do we do? 🤔
We keep password and balance as private 🔒
This prevents them from being accessed directly from outside the class.

If needed, we provide public methods (like checkBalance() or deposit()) to access or modify them safely 🛡️.

This way:

Data stays secure

Direct misuse is prevented

Access is controlled
