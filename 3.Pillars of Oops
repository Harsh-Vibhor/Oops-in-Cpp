There are four pillars of OOP 🏛️

1) Encapsulation
One of them is Encapsulation.

🔹 Encapsulation means wrapping data members (variables) and methods (functions) together into a single unit called a class 📦.

It is mainly used to achieve data hiding 🔒.

👉 In simple words:
Encapsulation decides what data should be visible and what data should be hidden from the outside world.

Understanding with a real-life example 🏦

Think of a banking system.

An account has:

Account ID

Username

Password

Balance

Now, as a user:

✅ You can see account ID and username

❌ You should NOT directly access password and balance

So what do we do? 🤔
We keep password and balance as private 🔒
This prevents them from being accessed directly from outside the class.

If needed, we provide public methods (like checkBalance() or deposit()) to access or modify them safely 🛡️.

This way:

Data stays secure

Direct misuse is prevented

Access is controlled


2) Inheritance
🧬 Inheritance in C++

Inheritance means when the properties (data) and methods (functions) of a parent/base class are passed to a child/derived class.

📌 Main benefit:
♻️ Code reusability – we don’t have to write the same code again.

🔁 Order of Constructor & Destructor Calls

🏗 Constructor Call Order:
Parent class constructor → Child class constructor

🧹 Destructor Call Order:
Child class destructor → Parent class destructor

Why?
Because the child depends on the parent, so the parent must be ready first, and cleaned last.

🔐 Modes of Inheritance

There are three modes of inheritance:

🌍 Public

Public members of parent stay public in child

🛡 Protected

Public & protected members become protected in child

🔒 Private

Public & protected members become private in child

These modes control how accessible the inherited members are.

🏗 Types of Inheritance

1️⃣ Single Inheritance
One parent → One child
Simple and common.

2️⃣ Multilevel Inheritance
Parent → Child → Grandchild
Inheritance happens at multiple levels.

3️⃣ Multiple Inheritance
One child inherits from multiple parents.

4️⃣ Hierarchical Inheritance
One parent → Multiple children.

5️⃣ Hybrid Inheritance
Combination of two or more types of inheritance.

⚡ Quick Summary

Inheritance = reusing parent class features 🧬

Saves time & code ♻️

Constructor: Parent → Child

Destructor: Child → Parent
