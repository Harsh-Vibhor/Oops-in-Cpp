Access Specifiers in C++

Access specifiers control who can access the data members and member functions of a class.

There are three access specifiers:

🔒 Private

Accessible only inside the class

❌ Not accessible outside

❌ Not accessible by derived classes

Used to protect internal data

🌍 Public

Accessible from anywhere

Used to interact with the class from outside

Acts as the interface of the class

🛡 Protected

Accessible inside the class

Accessible by derived (child) classes

❌ Not accessible from outside using objects

In C++, class members are private by default 🔒
So if you don’t write any access specifier, the properties and methods cannot be accessed from outside the class.

This default behavior helps in data hiding and keeps the code safe 🛡️.

✨ Why access specifiers matters?
Access specifiers help keep code secure, organized, and easy to maintain — which is why they’re heavily used in real-world C++ projects.
