🏗 Constructors in C++

Constructors are special member functions that are automatically called when an object is created 🔁.
They are mainly used for initializing data members.

✨ Key points about constructors:

Have the same name as the class

❌ Do not have a return type (not even void)

Are called only once, at the time of object creation

Used to initialize variables

Run after memory for the object is allocated

🔁 Constructor Overloading

A class can have multiple constructors, but their parameter lists must be different.
This is called constructor overloading 🔄.

📌 Types of Constructors

1️⃣ Non-Parameterized Constructor

Takes no arguments

Used for default initialization

2️⃣ Parameterized Constructor

Takes parameters

Used to initialize objects with custom values

3️⃣ Copy Constructor

Used to copy data from one object to another

Automatically created by the compiler if not defined

Syntax usually looks like:
ClassName(const ClassName &obj)

📌 Purpose:
Create a new object as a copy of an existing object.

👉 this Pointer

this is a special pointer in C++ that points to the current object 🧭.

It is mainly used:

To distinguish between data members and parameters with the same name

To refer to the calling object

📋 Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

🔹 Shallow Copy

Copies all member values as they are

If the object has pointers, only the pointer address is copied

Multiple objects may point to the same memory ⚠️

🔹 Deep Copy

Copies member values

Also creates separate copies of dynamically allocated memory

Each object has its own independent memory ✅

⚡ Quick Summary

Constructors initialize objects 🏗

Constructor overloading allows flexibility 🔄

Copy constructor duplicates objects 📄

this points to the current object 👉

Deep copy is safer than shallow copy when dynamic memory is involved 🛡️

🧹 Destructors in C++

Destructors are special member functions in C++ that are used to clean up resources used by an object 🧼.

They are automatically called when an object is destroyed.

🔑 Key Points about Destructors

🧾 A destructor:

Has the same name as the class, but with a tilde (~) before it

Has no return type

Takes no parameters

Is called automatically when the object goes out of scope or is deleted

🧠 Important Clarifications

When an object is destroyed:

The memory of the object itself is freed automatically by C++

You do NOT need to free that memory manually

What the destructor actually does 🧹:

It is used to clean up resources that the object was using

These resources include:

Memory allocated using new

Open files

Network connections

Any external resources

👉 Important rule:
If you used new inside a class, you must use delete inside the destructor.

Simple analogy 🏠

Think of an object as a rented house:

When you leave the house, the house is returned automatically 🏡

But you must clean your stuff (furniture, trash, belongings)

The destructor is the cleanup step before leaving.

One-line version (perfect for notes/interview):

A destructor does not free the object’s memory; it is used to release resources like dynamically allocated memory before the object is destroyed.
Network connections, etc.

⚙ Default Destructor

If you do not create a destructor, the compiler provides a default destructor 🤖

The default destructor does NOT free dynamically allocated memory

👉 If your class uses new, you must use delete inside the destructor to avoid memory leaks 🚰

Example idea:

new → allocate memory

delete → free memory (inside destructor)

⏱ When is Destructor Called?

A destructor is called:

When an object goes out of scope

When an object is destroyed using delete

At program termination (for static objects)

⚡ One-line Takeaway

Destructors are used to clean up resources and are automatically called when an object is destroyed, but dynamic memory must be freed manually inside them.
